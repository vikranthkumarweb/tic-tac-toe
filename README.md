# tic-tac-toe

Tic-tac-toe is a classic two-player game that is played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking a square with their designated symbol, usually "X" for one player and "O" for the other. The goal of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Here are the basic rules:

Game Setup:
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players decide who goes first; one player is "X," and the other is "O."

Gameplay:
Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty square on the grid.
Once a square is marked, it cannot be changed or overwritten.

Winning:
A player wins by having three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
If the entire grid is filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

Strategy:
The key to winning is blocking your opponent from getting three in a row while also trying to create your own winning sequences.
